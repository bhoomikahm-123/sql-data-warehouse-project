# Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project  

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project!** 🚀  
This repository showcases a complete end-to-end **data warehousing and analytics pipeline** — from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in **data engineering, data modeling, and analytics reporting**, aligned with industry standards.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

The project is designed using the **Medallion Architecture** approach, with three structured layers:  

- **Bronze Layer**: Ingests unprocessed data directly from source systems. Raw CSV files are imported into a SQL Server database.  
- **Silver Layer**: Performs data cleansing, standardization, and validation to ensure high-quality, analysis-ready data.  
- **Gold Layer**: Creates curated, business-ready datasets modeled in a **Star Schema**, optimized for reporting and BI dashboards.  

---

## 📖 Project Scope  

This project covers:  
- **Data Architecture**: Implementation of a modern warehouse using layered architecture.  
- **ETL Development**: Building extraction, transformation, and loading pipelines.  
- **Data Modeling**: Designing fact and dimension tables for efficient querying.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generating actionable insights through SQL-based queries and dashboards.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  

By exploring this repository, you’ll gain hands-on experience in:  
- SQL Development & Query Optimization  
- Data Warehousing Concepts (Bronze/Silver/Gold)  
- ETL Pipeline Development  
- Data Modeling & Star Schema Design

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources  

All tools and datasets used here are **open-source or free**:  
- **Datasets**: Provided CSV files (ERP & CRM data sources).  
- **MySQL Server**: Database engine for hosting the warehouse.  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: GUI for managing the SQL Server database.  
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.  
- **DrawIO**: Used for diagrams (data architecture, flows, models).  
- **Notion Template**: Project steps and documentation template.

## 🚀 Project Requirements  

### 1. Data Engineering – Build the Warehouse  
**Objective**: Create a consolidated warehouse in SQL Server for analytical reporting.  

**Key Specifications**:  
- Import ERP & CRM data from CSV files.  
- Cleanse and standardize raw data.  
- Integrate sources into a single, unified model.  
- Implement star schema for optimized queries.  
- Provide clear documentation.  

### 2. Data Analysis – Insights & Reporting  
**Objective**: Deliver SQL-driven insights that answer business-critical questions.  

**Focus Areas**:  
- **Customer Behavior** → Who are the top customers? Which ones are at risk?  
- **Product Performance** → Which products drive sales? Which underperform?  
- **Sales Trends** → Monthly, quarterly, and yearly breakdowns.  

Outputs include **reports, KPIs, and insights** ready for business stakeholders.
